# hello there cs50 team ,my name is Fabian Cretu and I wannted to thank you for this amazing course , i really enjoyed building this project
# i took the time to add some extra features along with comments to maybe make it easier for you guys to understand


#just for clarification this hidden feature is not a part of the project, it's just a hidden feature that I added for privacy reasons

# hidden function 
def _hidden_easter_egg():
    print("Â© Made by Fabian C. All rights reserved.")

#this is the modified index function. i made it so that it satisfies the specifications fo "active listing page" and i also added my own personal touch to it
#it not only "displays (at minimum) the title, description, current price, and photo (if one exists for the listing)" as the site specifies but also displays 
#the owner of the product and the date it was posted also the highest bidder and if the user is logged in it also displays 
# if the product is in the user's watchlist and if the user is the owner of the product it also displays "you own this auction" and 
# if the product is poseted by an admin it also displays "posted by an admin"
